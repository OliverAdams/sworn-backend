## Settlement Service Features

The settlement service implementation provides the following features:

1. **Resource Production**
   - Buildings produce resources based on their type
   - Seasonal modifiers affect production rates
   - Resources are stored in the settlement's inventory

2. **Population Growth**
   - Population grows based on available food and housing
   - Seasonal modifiers affect growth rates
   - Food is consumed by the population

3. **Building Construction and Repairs**
   - Buildings require resources to construct
   - Construction progresses over time
   - Damaged buildings can be repaired
   - Different building types provide different benefits

4. **Settlement Creation**
   - New settlements can be created with starting buildings
   - Initial resources and population are provided

5. **API Endpoints**
   - Get settlement information
   - Get settlement buildings
   - Get settlement resources
   - Start construction of new buildings
   - Start repair of damaged buildings
   - Trigger settlement processing manually
   - Get resource sites associated with the settlement

## Next Steps

1. Implement time_service.py and time_worker_new.py
2. Implement world_service.py and world_router_new.py
3. Implement area_service.py and area_router_new.py
4. Complete WorldManager implementation
5. Create comprehensive unit tests for the new components
6. Document the overall architecture
