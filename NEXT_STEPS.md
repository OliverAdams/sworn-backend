# Next Steps for Sworn Backend

## 1. MCTS Implementation

The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) system is now integrated for intelligent decision-making. Progress so far:

✓ Standardized the MCTS core in `app/ai/mcts/core.py`
✓ Created state representations in `app/ai/mcts/states/` for all entity types
✓ Implemented reward functions for evaluating entity decisions
✓ Added comprehensive action generation for all entities
✓ Integrated MCTS with service layers
✓ Created test script to demonstrate MCTS decision-making
✓ Eliminated duplicate state implementations by consolidating in `app/ai/mcts/states/`

Still to do:
- Create visualization tools for debugging decision trees
- Optimize simulation performance for real-time decisions
- Add neural network guidance for action evaluation
- Implement parallel MCTS for handling multiple entities simultaneously
✓ Create comprehensive test suite for MCTS state implementations
- Update remaining decision makers to use the new MCTS state format

## 2. State Management Improvements

With the refactored state system in place:

- Add documentation for all state classes to explain intended usage and patterns
- Implement caching strategies for state creation to improve performance
- Create state factory functions to simplify state instantiation
- Add serialization/deserialization methods for saving/loading states
- Implement validation to ensure state integrity
- Create utilities for state debugging and visualization

## 3. Unit Testing

Comprehensive testing infrastructure:

✓ Create test fixtures for all entity types and services
- Implement unit tests for each service method
- Add integration tests for service-worker interactions
