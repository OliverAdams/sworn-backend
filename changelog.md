# Trader Task Processing Improvements
Sat Mar 29 15:58:20 CET 2025

## Changes Made:

1. Created a more robust check_trader_active_tasks function that queries the Tasks table directly to find active tasks by target_id

2. Updated process_trader_movement, continue_area_travel, and process_all_traders to use this approach

3. Added code to clear trader.active_task_id when a task is completed or failed in task_manager.py

4. Added more detailed logging to help diagnose task-related issues

5. Improved the reporting in process_all_traders to show the number of traders in each state

## Benefits:

- More reliable tracking of trader tasks
- Automatic self-healing of stale active_task_id references
- Better logging and diagnostics for trader task processing
- Groundwork for future support of multiple tasks per entity
